# Charades-definitions

In this charades game, if a player gets stuck on a word they don't know or need inspiration for, they can get a definiton for the word they have been given.

If a player does select to look up the defination(s), on the timer they lose 10 secs. 

Make sure that pressing A (begin turn), q (quit), space (guessed correctly) occur in the window that pops up.

You also need to have [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) installed.
